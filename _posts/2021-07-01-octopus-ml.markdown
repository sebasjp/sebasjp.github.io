## Introduction

OctopusML is a Machine Learning Workflow proposed in Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. One task of a Machine Learning Engineer is to design and build applications that automate the execution of predictive models. The goal of this project is to implement a machine learning workflow to increase the efficiency in supervised learning specifically in binary classification problems. The idea is that it can be seen like a baseline for any Data Analyst or Data Scientist.

## How to use it
For more information about how to implement Octopus ML please visit the [repo](https://github.com/sebasjp/octopus-ml). There you can fin notebooks that explain with examples how to use the proposed framework.
